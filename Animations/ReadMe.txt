Hey all,

	the project Animations is done to show how a form can be shaped with a picture. the form, when shaped continuously with a continuous picture, u see an animation. simple.....
	i think i should take this oppurtunity to thank Eric O'Sullivan for Scrolling credits and £ºWXJ_Lake for the form shaping code. thank you guys... and what a wonderful job u have done..!!!
	guys the source code included is freely usable, and pls don't hesitate to include at least Eric O'Sullivan's and £ºWXJ_Lake's name when you use the program.

A little explanation
	The code uses a bmp file, which was created by extracting each frame from an animated GIF, and continuously pasting it to the bmp. (With the aid of a GIF creating tool u can do that). Then These bitmap files are assigned to a pictureClip control's picture property, which uses each frame as a graphic cell. Just as the particular frame is displayed as the form's picture, the form is bathed (...????) in the form shaping code, which shapes the form in to the shape of the particular image. The process is continued.

pls send me some comments.... ok?
